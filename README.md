# signalo

## Synopsis

A DSP toolbox with focus on embedded environments.

Signalo provides the **basic building-blocks** for **low-level real-time filtering pipelines**,  
based on zero-cost, zero-allocation abstractions, which can be **assembled via composition**.

## About

Signalo basically consists of four basic [traits](./crates/traits) and implementations thereof:

- [`Source<T>`](./crates/sources): `() -> T`
- [`Filter<T>`](./crates/filters): `T -> U`
- [`Sink<T>`](./crates/sinks): `T -> ()`
- `Finalize`: `() -> U`

Roughly signalo's traits are equivalent in semantics to the following stdlib APIs:

- `Source<…>` ≈ `core::iter::Iterator<…>`
- `Filter<…>` ≈ `core::iter::Map<…>`
- `Sink<…> + Finalize` ≈ `Iterator::fold(…)`
- `Filter<…> + Finalize` ≈ `core::iter::Scan<…>`

Types implementing `Finalize` usually also implement either `Filter<T>` or `Sink<T>`.

Signalo provides the **basic building-blocks** for **low-level real-time filtering pipelines**,  
which can be **assembled via composition** either manually or through the use of [pipes](./crates/pipes).
