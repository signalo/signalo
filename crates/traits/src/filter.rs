//! Filters of a digital signal.

/// Filters accept values of a signal, and produce transformed values.
/// Furthermore, the result of concatenating all the output data is the same as the result
/// of applying the filter over the concatenation of the input data.

/// Trait for **arbitrarily phase shifting** systems.
///
/// # Background:
///
/// Phase shift is any change that occurs in the phase of one quantity,
/// or in the phase difference between two or more quantities.
///
/// This symbol: `φ` is sometimes referred to as a phase shift or phase offset
/// because it represents a "shift" from zero phase.
///
/// For infinitely long sinusoids, a change in `φ` is the same as a shift in time,
/// such as a time delay. If `x(t)` is delayed (time-shifted) by `1/4` of its cycle, it becomes:
///
/// ```plain
/// x(t - 1/4 T) = A * cos(2π * f(t - 1/4 T) + φ)
///              = A * cos(2π * f * t - π/2 + φ)
/// ```
///
/// whose "phase" is now `φ - π/2`. It has been shifted by `π/2` radians
/// (the variable `A` here just represents the amplitude of the wave).

/// Trait for **linearly phase shifting** systems.
///
/// # Background:
///
/// A system is called linear if it follows these two principles:
///
/// 1. **Superposition**:
///
///   Let `x1(t)`, `x2(t)` be the inputs applied to a system and `y1(t)`, `y2(t)` be the outputs.
///   For `x1(t)` the output of the system is `y1(t)` and for `x2(t)` output of the system `y2(t)`
///   then for `x1(t) + x2(t)` if the output of the system is `y1(t) + y2(t)` then system is said
///   to be obeying superposition principle.
///
/// 2. **Homogeneity**:
///
///   Consider for an input `x(t)` for which output of the system is `y(t)`. Then if for the input
///   `ax(t)` (where a is some constant value) output is `ay(t)` then system is said to be obeying
///   homogeneity principle. Consequence of the homogeneity (or scaling) property is that a zero
///   input to the system yields a zero output.
///
/// If the above two property are satisfied system is said to be a linear system.

/// Trait for **time-invariant** systems.
///
/// # Background:
///
/// A time shift in the input does not affect the properties of the output.
/// More specifically, if `f(x(t)) = y(t)`, then `f(x(t-T)) = y(t-T)`, where `T` is the time shift.
///
/// A system is called time-invariant if a time shift (delay or advance) in the input signal
/// causes the same time shift in the output signal. Consider for an input signal `x(t)` the
/// `response(output)` of the system is `y(t)`, then for system to be time invariant, for an input
/// `x(t-k)` `response(output)` should be `y(t-k)` (where `k` is some constant shift in time).
///
/// Time invariance is the property of a system which makes the behavior of the system
/// independent of time. This means the behavior of system does not depend on time at which
/// input is applied. For the discrete time system time invariance is called shift invariance.

/// Trait for **shift-invariant** filters.
///
/// # Background:
///
/// A shift invariant system is the **discrete equivalent of a time-invariant system
/// (see [`TimeInvariant`](trait.TimeInvariant.html))**, defined such that if `y(n)` is the response of the system to `x(n)`,
/// then `y(n–k)` is the response of the system to `x(n–k)`.
///
/// That is, in a shift-invariant system
/// the contemporaneous response of the output variable to a given value of the input variable
/// does not depend on when the input occurs; time shifts are irrelevant in this regard.

/// and previous input values**.
///
/// Contrarily a system that **has some dependence on input values from the future**
/// (in addition to possible past or current input values) **is termed an acausal system**,
/// and a system that **depends solely on future input values is an anticausal system**.

/// Trait for **discrete-time** systems.
///
/// # Background:
///
/// Discrete time views values of variables as **occurring at distinct,
/// separate _points in time_** ("samples" or "time period"), or equivalently as being unchanged
/// throughout each sample — that is, **time is viewed as a discrete variable**.
///
/// Thus a non-time variable **jumps from one value to another** as **time moves from one
/// sample/time period to the next**. (This view of time corresponds to a digital clock
/// that gives a fixed reading of 10:37 for a while, and then jumps to a
/// new fixed reading of 10:38, etc.)
///
/// In this framework, each **variable of interest is measured once at each time period**.
/// The **number of measurements** between any two time periods **is finite**.
///
/// Measurements are typically made at sequential integer values of the variable "time".

/// # Background:

///
/// Between any two points in time there are an **infinite number of other points in time**.
///
/// The variable "time" **ranges over the non-negative entire real number line**, or depending on the context,
/// over **some subset of it**. Thus **time is viewed as a continuous variable**.
