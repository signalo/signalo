## Synopsis

A collection of common traits shared between signalo's workspace crates.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ⚠️ This is the last published version of `signalo-traits`. All `signalo-*` crates are being merged into a single [`signalo`](https://crates.io/crates/signalo) crate. Future development and updates will happen in the unified crate.
