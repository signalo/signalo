//! Lagrange fractional-delay FIR filters.
//!
//! A fractional-delay filter shifts a signal by a non-integer number of
//! samples using Lagrange polynomial interpolation. For a desired delay
//! `δ ∈ [0, M−1]` and `M` taps, the coefficients are:
//!
//! ```text
//! h[k] = ∏_{j=0, j≠k}^{M−1} (δ − j) / (k − j),    k = 0 … M−1
//! ```
//!
//! The filter is exact for polynomial signals up to degree `M−1`.
//!
//! # Use cases
//!
//! - Sensor fusion with timestamp misalignment.
//! - Resampling and sample-rate conversion (as a building block).
//! - Delay compensation in beamforming or antenna arrays.
//!
//! # Trade-offs vs. windowed-sinc
//!
//! Lagrange is cheap and exact for low-order polynomial signals, but has
//! wider transition bands than windowed-sinc. Prefer Lagrange when
//! per-sample latency matters more than frequency-domain control.
//!
//! # Numerical caveats
//!
//! The best numerical behaviour is for `δ` near the centre tap
//! (approximately `(M−1)/2`). Ill-conditioning increases near the edges
//! (`δ ≈ 0` or `δ ≈ M−1`).
//!
//! # Related
//!
//! - [`crate::filters::delay::Delay`] for integer delay.
//! - [`crate::filters::fir::convolve::windowed_sinc`] for frequency-domain
//!   fractional-delay alternatives via windowed-sinc resampling.
//!
//! # Half-sample delay
//!
//! `half_sample_delay()` is pre-defined for even `M ∈ {4, 6, 8, 10}`. Odd `M`
//! yields `(M−1)/2 ∈ ℤ` — that is an *integer* delay and should use
//! [`Delay`](crate::filters::delay::Delay) (or
//! [`Convolve::with_config`](crate::filters::fir::convolve::Convolve::with_config)
//! with a unit impulse at the relevant tap).
//!
//! `h[k]` pairs with the newest sample, so `δ = 0` outputs `x[n]` and
//! `δ = M − 1` outputs `x[n − (M − 1)]`. The Lagrange formula in this
//! module produces coefficients in exactly that order — no reversal is
//! needed at storage time.
//!
